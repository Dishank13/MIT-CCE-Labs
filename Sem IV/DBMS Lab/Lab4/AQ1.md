    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count

    FROM shipment s2
    WHERE s2.order_num = s.order_num

GROUP BY c.cust_num, c.cname
ORDER BY total_order_amount DESC;
```

SELECT c.cust_num, c.cname, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM customer c
JOIN orders o ON c.cust_num = o.cust_num
JOIN shipment s ON o.order_num = s.order_num
WHERE s.shipdate = TO_DATE('2025-01-06', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
