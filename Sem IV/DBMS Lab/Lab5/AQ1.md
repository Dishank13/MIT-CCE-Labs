GROUP BY item#
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT order#) = (
    SELECT MAX(customer_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT item#, COUNT(DISTINCT O.cust#) AS customer_count
        FROM ORDER_ITEMS OI
        JOIN ORDERS O ON OI.order# = O.order#
        GROUP BY item#
    ) AS item_customer_counts
);

```

## 5. Select all those items which have not been bought by any customer.

        WHERE s1.shipdate = 'YYYY-MM-DD'  -- First specified date
    )
) 
AND c.cust# IN (
    SELECT o.cust# 
    FROM ORDERS o
    WHERE o.order# IN (

FROM CUSTOMER c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM ORDERS o

    HAVING COUNT(o.order#) = (
        SELECT MAX(order_count)
        FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(order#) AS order_count
            FROM ORDERS
